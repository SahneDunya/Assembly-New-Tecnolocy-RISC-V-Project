    # Data specific to parser (e.g., operator precedence table, AST node structures)
    # AST node structure definitions (in Assembly data sections)
    # Example:
    # struct_ast_match:
    #   .word offset_of_condition_expr # Pointer to match expression AST node
    #   .word offset_of_cases_list     # Pointer to list of case nodes

# parse: Parses the token stream and builds the AST.
# Arguments:
# a0: Pointer to the lexer state (from lexer_init).
# Returns:
# a0: Pointer to the root of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or 0 on error.

    # Function prologue
    addi sp, sp, -16 # Adjust stack pointer
    sd ra, 0(sp)     # Save return address
    sd s0, 8(sp)     # Save s0 (will use for lexer state)
    mv s0, a0        # s0 now holds the lexer state pointer

    # --- Parsing Logic (Highly Simplified Placeholder) ---
    # In a real scenario, this would implement a parsing algorithm (e.g., recursive descent).
    # It would repeatedly call get_next_token, check the token type, and build AST nodes.
    # Handling the 'match' statement involves recognizing the 'match' keyword,
    # parsing the expression to be matched, and then parsing the list of case branches.

    # Example: Just pretend to consume a couple of tokens
    # This is NOT a real parsing implementation!

    # Get the first token
    mv a0, s0        # Pass lexer state to get_next_token
    jal get_next_token # Call lexer

    # Let's assume get_next_token returned TOKEN_MATCH in a0 and no value in a1
    # Check if the token is 'match'
    li t0, TOKEN_MATCH
    bne a0, t0, handle_syntax_error # If not 'match', handle error (needs implementation)

    # --- Successfully recognized 'match' keyword ---
    # Now, need to parse the expression after 'match', the '{', cases, '}'
    # This requires recursive calls to parsing routines for expressions, lists, etc.

    # Example: Get the next token (should be '{')
    mv a0, s0        # Pass lexer state
    jal get_next_token # Call lexer

    li t0, TOKEN_LBRACE
    bne a0, t0, handle_syntax_error # If not '{', handle error

    # --- Recognized '{' ---
    # Now parse the case branches until '}'
    # This involves looping and calling a parse_case_branch routine

    # Example: Get the next token (should be '}')
    mv a0, s0        # Pass lexer state
    jal get_next_token # Call lexer

    li t0, TOKEN_RBRACE
    bne a0, t0, handle_syntax_error # If not '}', handle error

    # --- Recognized '}' ---
    # Match statement successfully (superficially) parsed!
    # In a real parser, you would have built an AST node for the match statement here.
    # For this skeleton, let's just return a dummy AST root pointer.

    # Allocate memory for the root AST node (Needs memory allocation)
    # li a0, size_of_ast_root_node
    # jal mem_alloc
    # mv t0, a0 # t0 holds the pointer to the AST root

    # Initialize the AST root node (set type, children pointers etc. based on parsed structure)
    # For example, set type to AST_NODE_PROGRAM
    # sd AST_NODE_PROGRAM, type_offset(t0)
    # ...

    mv a0, t0        # Return the pointer to the AST root (or 0 on error)
    # For this skeleton, return a dummy non-zero pointer
    li a0, 1 # Dummy pointer indicating success

    # Function epilogue
    ld ra, 0(sp)     # Restore return address
    ld s0, 8(sp)     # Restore s0
    addi sp, sp, 16  # Restore stack pointer
    jr ra            # Return

# --- Error Handling Placeholders (Need implementation) ---
handle_syntax_error:
    # Print detailed syntax error message (e.g., unexpected token, expected '}')
    # Use lexer state (s0) to get line/column info
    # Exit with error code
    # ...
    li a0, 0 # Return 0 to indicate parser failure
    j parser_epilogue # Jump to epilogue to cleanup stack

parser_epilogue: # Common exit point for parse function
    ld ra, 0(sp)
    ld s0, 8(sp)
    addi sp, sp, 16
