    # --- Code Generation Logic (Highly Simplified Placeholder) ---
    # This involves traversing the AST and emitting RISC-V Assembly instructions for each node.

    # Initialize code generation state (e.g., buffer pointer, label counters)
    # la t0, generated_code_buffer # Load address of buffer
    # la t1, buffer_ptr        # Load address of buffer pointer variable
    # sd t0, 0(t1)           # Store buffer address in buffer_ptr variable

    # Start recursive traversal of the AST to generate code
    # Need a helper function like `generate_code_for_node`
    mv a0, s0        # Pass AST root to generation helper
    # Also pass code generation state (e.g., current buffer pointer, register allocation info)
    # mv a1, generation_state_ptr # Hypothetical pointer
    # jal generate_code_for_node # Hypothetical call

    # --- Inside `generate_code_for_node` (Conceptual Logic Sketch) ---
    # generate_code_for_node:
    #   # Get AST node type from pointer (a0)
    #   ld t0, type_offset(a0)
    #
    #   # Check node type and generate appropriate Assembly
    #   beq t0, AST_NODE_VARIABLE_DECL, generate_variable_declaration_code
    #   beq t0, AST_NODE_ASSIGNMENT, generate_assignment_code
    #   beq t0, AST_NODE_MATCH, generate_match_code
    #   beq t0, AST_NODE_FUNCTION_CALL, generate_function_call_code
    #   # ... other node types (literals, operators, blocks) ...
    #
    #   # Example: generate_assignment_code (assuming simple integer assignment `x = y`)
    #   #   # Get pointers to left and right side expressions
    #   #   ld t1, left_expr_offset(a0)  # Node for 'x'
    #   #   ld t2, right_expr_offset(a0) # Node for 'y'
    #   #
    #   #   # Generate code for the right side expression (y) first.
    #   #   # This will evaluate 'y' and place its value in a register (e.g., t0)
    #   #   mv a0, t2; mv a1, generation_state_ptr; jal generate_code_for_node # Generate code for 'y'
    #   #   # Assume the value of 'y' is now in t0 after the call
    #   #
    #   #   # Generate code for the left side (x). This involves finding x's memory location.
    #   #   # Need symbol table lookup to find x's stack offset or global address.
    #   #   # mv a0, t1; mv a1, symbol_table_ptr; jal lookup_symbol_location # Hypothetical call
    #   #   # Assume location (base register + offset) is returned (e.g., base in t1, offset in t2)
    #   #
    #   #   # Store the value from t0 (result of y) into x's memory location
    #   #   # Store Word: sw t0, t2(t1) # For 32-bit int
    #   #   # Store Doubleword: sd t0, t2(t1) # For 64-bit int
    #   #   # Need helper to emit Assembly instructions into the buffer (see emit_instruction below)

    #
    #   # Example: generate_match_code
    #   #   # Generate code for the match expression (e.g., evaluate it into register t0)
    #   #   # Get pointer to match expression node: ld t1, match_expr_offset(a0)
    #   #   # mv a0, t1; mv a1, generation_state_ptr; jal generate_code_for_node
    #   #   # Assume match expression value is in t0
    #   #
    #   #   # Get pointer to list of case branches
    #   #   # ld t1, match_cases_offset(a0)
    #   #
    #   #   # For each case branch:
    #   #   # Generate a unique label for the start of this case's body.
    #   #   # Generate code to evaluate the case pattern/condition.
    #   #   # Example: `match expr { case pattern => ... }`
    #   #   #   Generate code to compare t0 (expr value) with the pattern value.
    #   #   #   Need to handle different pattern types (literals, ranges, potentially deconstruction).
    #   #   #   Based on the comparison result, generate a conditional branch.
    #   #   #   Example: `bne t0, pattern_value_reg, next_case_label`
    #   #   #   If values match, the code falls through to this case's body.
    #   #   #
    #   #   #   Generate the label for this case's body.
    #   #   #   # emit_label(case_body_label)
    #   #   #
    #   #   #   Generate code for the case body (recursive call).

    #   #   #   mv a0, t2; mv a1, generation_state_ptr; jal generate_code_for_node
    #   #   #   # Check return value for errors...
    #   #   #
    #   #   #   After executing a case body, need to jump to the end of the match statement
    #   #   #   to avoid executing subsequent cases.

    #   #   # If this is the last case (and not a 'catch-all'), also need a branch
    #   #   # after the initial comparison if no match occurs.
    #   #
    #   # After iterating through all cases, generate the end of match label.
