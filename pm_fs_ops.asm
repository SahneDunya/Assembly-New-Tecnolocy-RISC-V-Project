# pm_create_directory: Creates a directory.

# pm_copy_file: Copies a file from source path to destination path.
# This is a complex operation involving open, read, write, close syscalls
# in a loop, handling buffer management and error checking at each step.
# Arguments:
# a0: Pointer to source path string.
# a1: Pointer to destination path string.
# Returns:

    # 1. Open source file for reading (open syscall). Check error, get fd.
    # 2. Open/Create destination file for writing (open syscall with O_CREAT, O_WRONLY, O_TRUNC). Check error, get fd.
    # 3. Loop:
    #    a. Read a chunk of data from source fd into a buffer (read syscall). Check error, check EOF.
    #    b. If data read, write the chunk from buffer to destination fd (write syscall). Check error.
    #    c. Repeat until EOF on source.
    # 4. Close both file descriptors (close syscall). Check errors.
    # 5. Handle errors at any step (close open fds before exiting on error).

# pm_read_file_content: Reads the entire content of a file into a dynamically allocated buffer.
# Arguments:
# a0: Pointer to the file path string.
# Returns:

    # 4. Read entire file content into the buffer (read syscall). Check error.
    # 5. Close the file descriptor (close syscall). Check error.
    # 6. Return buffer pointer (a0) and size (a1). Handle errors by returning 0 in a0.
