# check_ownership: Verifies ownership and borrowing rules within a given scope or AST node.
# Arguments:
# a0: Pointer to the AST node or scope to check (e.g., a block, a function body, a match branch).
#     Or perhaps the entire AST root, and it traverses relevant parts.
# a1: Context information (e.g., symbol table pointer, current variable lifetimes).
# Returns:
# a0: 0 if ownership/borrowing errors found, non-zero otherwise (success).
check_ownership:
    # Function prologue
    addi sp, sp, -16 # Adjust stack pointer
    sd ra, 0(sp)     # Save return address
    sd s0, 8(sp)     # Save s0 (will use for node/scope pointer)
    sd s1, 16(sp)    # Save s1 (will use for context)
    mv s0, a0        # s0 holds the node/scope pointer
    mv s1, a1        # s1 holds the context pointer

    # --- Ownership/Borrowing Logic (Extremely Simplified Conceptual Sketch) ---
    # This requires sophisticated data flow analysis and lifetime tracking.
    # You need to track for each piece of memory/variable:
    # 1. Who is the current owner?
    # 2. Are there any active mutable borrows?
    # 3. Are there any active immutable borrows?
    # 4. What is the variable's lifetime?

    # This check would likely involve traversing the specific node/scope provided (s0).
    # For each relevant statement (assignment, function call, variable declaration, reference creation '&'):

    # Conceptual Steps (Translated into theoretical Assembly needs):
    #
    # Traverse the statements/expressions within the scope (s0)
    # For each statement:
    #   Identify variables being accessed/modified (e.g., left side of assignment, function arguments).
    #   Identify if a reference is being created (the '&' operator).
    #   Determine if ownership is being moved (e.g., by assignment of an owned value).
    #
    #   Example: Handling an assignment `x = y` where `y` is owned:
    #   # Need to look up 'x' and 'y' in the symbol table (using s1 context)
    #   # Check if 'x' is mutable. If not, report error.
    #   # Check if 'y' has any active borrows. If so, report error (cannot move an actively borrowed value).
    #   # Perform the ownership transfer:
    #   #   Mark 'y' as moved/invalidated for future access (requires updating state linked to symbol table entry for y).
    #   #   Make 'x' the new owner (requires updating state for x).
    #
    #   Example: Handling a mutable borrow `&mut x`:
    #   # Need to look up 'x' in the symbol table (s1 context).
    #   # Check if 'x' is mutable. If not, report error.
    #   # Check if 'x' already has any active mutable or immutable borrows. If so, report error (aliasing rules).
    #   # Record that 'x' now has one active mutable borrow (requires updating state for x).
    #   # When the borrow goes out of scope (requires lifetime analysis), remove the active borrow mark.
    #
    #   Example: Handling an immutable borrow `&x`:
    #   # Need to look up 'x'.
    #   # Check if 'x' has any active mutable borrows. If so, report error (mutable XOR immutable rule).
    #   # Record that 'x' now has one more active immutable borrow.
    #   # When the borrow goes out of scope, decrement the immutable borrow count.
    #
    #   Example: Function Calls `my_func(val)`:
    #   # Need to know the function signature's ownership/borrowing requirements for parameters.
    #   # If `val` is passed by value (ownership move), apply ownership transfer rules.
    #   # If `val` is passed by reference (borrow), apply borrowing rules based on the reference type (mutable/immutable).
    #
    # To implement this in Assembly, you would need:
    # - Functions to look up symbols and their associated ownership/borrowing state.
    # - Data structures to store ownership/borrowing state (perhaps added to symbol table entries).
    # - Logic to traverse the code flow and update/check this state at each relevant instruction/AST node.
    # - Lifetime analysis logic to determine when borrows end (complex!).

    # This is extremely difficult to represent concisely in Assembly.
    # The actual code would involve intricate loops, conditional checks,
    # and manual manipulation of memory structures representing the analysis state.

    # Assume, for this skeleton, that the check was performed and results are available.
    # Check if any ownership/borrowing errors were found (e.g., in a global or context-specific flag).
    # li t0, ownership_error_flag_address
    # lb a0, 0(t0)    # Load the error flag
    # xori a0, a0, 1  # Invert: 1 for success, 0 for error

    # For this skeleton, assume success
    li a0, 1 # Indicate success (dummy)

    # Function epilogue
    ld ra, 0(sp)     # Restore return address
    ld s0, 8(sp)     # Restore s0
    ld s1, 16(sp)    # Restore s1
    addi sp, sp, 16  # Restore stack pointer
    jr ra            # Return

# get_symbol_ownership_state: Lookup a symbol and return its current ownership/borrowing state.
# update_symbol_ownership_state: Change the state after a move or borrow.
# check_borrow_validity: Check if a requested borrow is allowed based on current state.
# report_ownership_error: Format and print an ownership-specific error message.
